A stateless firewall will check if the incoming packet has the SYN flag set to detect a connection attempt. Using a flag combination that does not match the SYN packet makes it possible to deceive the firewall and reach the system behind it. However, a stateful firewall will practically block all such crafted packets and render this kind of scan useless.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Questions-and-answers-of-the-task\"><a href=\"#Questions-and-answers-of-the-task\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Questions and answers of the task\"></a>Questions and answers of the task</h2><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/CJUgQ99.png\" alt=\"IMAGE1\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"TASK-3-TCP-Maimon-Scan\"><a href=\"#TASK-3-TCP-Maimon-Scan\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"TASK 3 - TCP  Maimon Scan\"></a>TASK 3 - TCP  Maimon Scan</h1><p>Uriel Maimon first described this scan in 1996. In this scan, the FIN and ACK bits are set. The target should send an RST packet as a response. However, certain BSD-derived systems drop the packet if it is an open port exposing the open ports. This scan won’t work on most targets encountered in modern networks; however, we include it in this room to better understand the port scanning mechanism and the hacking mindset. To select this scan type, use the -sM option.</p>\n<p>Most target systems respond with an RST packet regardless of whether the TCP port is open.

However, it is vital to remember that just because a firewall is not blocking a specific port, it does not necessarily mean that a service is listening on that port. For example, there is a possibility that the firewall rules need to be updated to reflect recent service changes. Hence, ACK and window scans are exposing the firewall rules, not the services.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Questions-and-Answers-of-this-Task\"><a href=\"#Questions-and-Answers-of-this-Task\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Questions and Answers of this Task\"></a>Questions and Answers of this Task</h2><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/B5lUXjA.png\" alt=\"img\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"TASK-5-Spoofing-and-Decoys\"><a href=\"#TASK-5-Spoofing-and-Decoys\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"TASK 5 Spoofing and Decoys\"></a>TASK 5 Spoofing and Decoys</h1><p>In some network setups, you will be able to scan a target system using a spoofed IP address and even a spoofed MAC address. Such a scan is only beneficial in a situation where you can guarantee to capture the response. If you try to scan a target from some random network using a spoofed IP address, chances are you won’t have any response routed to you, and the scan results could be unreliable.</p>\n<p>The following figure shows the attacker launching the command nmap -S SPOOFED_IP MACHINE_IP. Consequently, Nmap will craft all the packets using the provided source IP address SPOOFED_IP. The target machine will respond to the incoming packets sending the replies to the destination IP address SPOOFED_IP. For this scan to work and give accurate results, the attacker needs to monitor the network traffic to analyze the replies.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/45b982d501fd26deb2b381059b16f80c.png\" alt=\"img\"></p>\n<p>In brief, scanning with a spoofed IP address is three steps:</p>\n<p>Attacker sends a packet with a spoofed source IP address to the target machine.<br>Target machine replies to the spoofed IP address as the destination.<br>Attacker captures the replies to figure out open ports.<br>In general, you expect to specify the network interface using -e and to explicitly disable ping scan -Pn. Therefore, instead of nmap -S SPOOFED_IP MACHINE_IP, you will need to issue nmap -e NET_INTERFACE -Pn -S SPOOFED_IP MACHINE_IP to tell Nmap explicitly which network interface to use and not to expect to receive a ping reply. It is worth repeating that this scan will be useless if the attacker system cannot monitor the network for responses.</p>\n<p>When you are on the same subnet as the target machine, you would be able to spoof your MAC address as well. You can specify the source MAC address using –spoof-mac SPOOFED_MAC. This address spoofing is only possible if the attacker and the target machine are on the same Ethernet (802.3) network or same WiFi (802.11).</p>\n<p>Spoofing only works in a minimal number of cases where certain conditions are met. Therefore, the attacker might resort to using decoys to make it more challenging to be pinpointed. The concept is simple, make the scan appear to be coming from many IP addresses so that the attacker’s IP address would be lost among them. As we see in the figure below, the scan of the target machine will appear to be coming from 3 different sources, and consequently, the replies will go the decoys as well.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/754fc455556a424ca83f512665beaf7d.png\" alt=\"img\"></p>\n<p>You can launch a decoy scan by specifying a specific or random IP address after -D. For example, nmap -D 10.10.0.1,10.10.0.2,ME MACHINE_IP will make the scan of MACHINE_IP appear as coming from the IP addresses 10.10.0.1, 10.10.0.2, and then ME to indicate that your IP address should appear in the third order. Another example command would be nmap -D 10.10.0.1,10.10.0.2,RND,RND,ME MACHINE_IP, where the third and fourth source IP addresses are assigned randomly, while the fifth source is going to be the attacker’s IP address. In other words, each time you execute the latter command, you would expect two new random IP addresses to be the third and fourth decoy sources.</p>\n<h1 id=\"TASK-6-Fragmented-Packets\"><a href=\"#TASK-6-Fragmented-Packets\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"TASK 6 - Fragmented Packets\"></a>TASK 6 - Fragmented Packets</h1><h3 id=\"Firewall\"><a href=\"#Firewall\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Firewall\"></a>Firewall</h3><p>A firewall is a piece of software or hardware that permits packets to pass through or blocks them. It functions based on firewall rules, summarized as blocking all traffic with exceptions or allowing all traffic with exceptions. For instance, you might block all traffic to your server except those coming to your web server. A traditional firewall inspects, at least, the IP header and the transport layer header. A more sophisticated firewall would also try to examine the data carried by the transport layer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"IDS\"><a href=\"#IDS\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"IDS\"></a>IDS</h3><p>An intrusion detection system (IDS) inspects network packets for select behavioural patterns or specific content signatures. It raises an alert whenever a malicious rule is met. In addition to the IP header and transport layer header, an IDS would inspect the data contents in the transport layer and check if it matches any malicious patterns. How can you make it less likely for a traditional firewall&#x2F;IDS to detect your Nmap activity? It is not easy to answer this; however, depending on the type of firewall&#x2F;IDS, you might benefit from dividing the packet into smaller packets.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Fragmented-Packets\"><a href=\"#Fragmented-Packets\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Fragmented Packets\"></a>Fragmented Packets</h3><p>Nmap provides the option -f to fragment packets. Once chosen, the IP data will be divided into 8 bytes or less. Adding another -f (-f -f or -ff) will split the data into 16 byte-fragments instead of 8. You can change the default value by using the –mtu; however, you should always choose a multiple of 8.</p>\n<p>To properly understand fragmentation, we need to look at the IP header in the figure below. It might look complicated at first, but we notice that we know most of its fields. In particular, notice the source address taking 32 bits (4 bytes) on the fourth row, while the destination address is taking another 4 bytes on the fifth row. The data that we will fragment across multiple packets is highlighted in red. To aid in the reassembly on the recipient side, IP uses the identification (ID) and fragment offset, shown on the second row of the figure below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/5e55834e2638ba7ec9e84a0900b68ccb.png\" alt=\"i\"></p>\n<p>Let’s compare running sudo nmap -sS -p80 10.20.30.144 and sudo nmap -sS -p80 -f 10.20.30.144. As you know by now, this will use stealth TCP SYN scan on port 80; however, in the second command, we are requesting Nmap to fragment the IP packets.</p>\n<p>In the first two lines, we can see an ARP query and response. Nmap issued an ARP query because the target is on the same Ethernet. The second two lines show a TCP SYN ping and a reply. The fifth line is the beginning of the port scan; Nmap sends a TCP SYN packet to port 80. In this case, the IP header is 20 bytes, and the TCP header is 24 bytes. Note that the minimum size of the TCP header is 20 bytes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/b817b7d8b8ef9ee64dd9494e31def426.png\" alt=\"w\"></p>\n<p>With fragmentation requested via -f, the 24 bytes of the TCP header will be divided into multiples of 8 bytes, with the last fragment containing 8 bytes or less of the TCP header. Since 24 is divisible by 8, we got 3 IP fragments; each has 20 bytes of IP header and 8 bytes of TCP header. We can see the three fragments between the fifth and the seventh lines.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/953fd599d2afaa8efb36923b02707d2b.png\" alt=\"1\"></p>\n<p>Note that if you added -ff (or -f -f), the fragmentation of the data will be multiples of 16. In other words, the 24 bytes of the TCP header, in this case, would be divided over two IP fragments, the first containing 16 bytes and the second containing 8 bytes of the TCP header.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you prefer to increase the size of your packets to make them look innocuous, you can use the option –data-length NUM, where num specifies the number of bytes you want to append to your packets.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Question-and-Answers-of-the-task\"><a href=\"#Question-and-Answers-of-the-task\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Question and Answers of the task\"></a>Question and Answers of the task</h2><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cgqsYlS.png\" alt=\"11\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"TASK-7-Idle-Zombie-Scan\"><a href=\"#TASK-7-Idle-Zombie-Scan\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"TASK 7 - Idle &#x2F; Zombie Scan\"></a>TASK 7 - Idle &#x2F; Zombie Scan</h1><p>Spoofing the source IP address can be a great approach to scanning stealthily. However, spoofing will only work in specific network setups. It requires you to be in a position where you can monitor the traffic. Considering these limitations, spoofing your IP address can have little use; however, we can give it an upgrade with the idle scan.</p>\n<p>The idle scan, or zombie scan, requires an idle system connected to the network that you can communicate with. Practically, Nmap will make each probe appear as if coming from the idle (zombie) host, then it will check for indicators whether the idle (zombie) host received any response to the spoofed probe. This is accomplished by checking the IP identification (IP ID) value in the IP header. You can run an idle scan using nmap -sI ZOMBIE_IP MACHINE_IP, where ZOMBIE_IP is the IP address of the idle host (zombie).</p>\n<p>The idle (zombie) scan requires the following three steps to discover whether a port is open:</p>\n<p>Trigger the idle host to respond so that you can record the current IP ID on the idle host.<br>Send a SYN packet to a TCP port on the target. The packet should be spoofed to appear as if it was coming from the idle host (zombie) IP address.<br>Trigger the idle machine again to respond so that you can compare the new IP ID with the one received earlier.<br>Let’s explain with figures. In the figure below, we have the attacker system probing an idle machine, a multi-function printer. By sending a SYN&#x2F;ACK, it responds with an RST packet containing its newly incremented IP ID.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/a93e181f0effe000554a8b307448bbb2.png\" alt=\"123\"></p>\n<p>The attacker will send a SYN packet to the TCP port they want to check on the target machine in the next step. However, this packet will use the idle host (zombie) IP address as the source. Three scenarios would arise. In the first scenario, shown in the figure below, the TCP port is closed; therefore, the target machine responds to the idle host with an RST packet. The idle host does not respond; hence its IP ID is not incremented.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/8e28bf940936ddbc2367b193ea3550b8.png\" alt=\"65\"></p>\n<p>In the second scenario, as shown below, the TCP port is open, so the target machine responds with a SYN&#x2F;ACK to the idle host (zombie). The idle host responds to this unexpected packet with an RST packet, thus incrementing its IP ID.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/2b0de492e2154a30760852e07cebae0e.png\" alt=\"fgrgt\"></p>\n<p>In the third scenario, the target machine does not respond at all due to firewall rules. This lack of response will lead to the same result as with the closed port; the idle host won’t increase the IP ID.</p>\n<p>For the final step, the attacker sends another SYN&#x2F;ACK to the idle host. The idle host responds with an RST packet, incrementing the IP ID by one again. The attacker needs to compare the IP ID of the RST packet received in the first step with the IP ID of the RST packet received in this third step. If the difference is 1, it means the port on the target machine was closed or filtered. However, if the difference is 2, it means that the port on the target was open.</p>\n<p>It is worth repeating that this scan is called an idle scan because choosing an idle host is indispensable for the accuracy of the scan.
