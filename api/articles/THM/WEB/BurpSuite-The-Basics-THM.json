Our focus will revolve around the following key aspects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A thorough introduction to Burp Suite.</li>\n<li>A comprehensive overview of the various tools available within the framework.</li>\n<li>Detailed guidance on the process of installing Burp Suite on your system.</li>\n<li>Navigating and configuring Burp Suite.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will also introduce the core of the Burp Suite framework, which is the Burp Proxy. It is important to note that this room primarily serves as a foundational resource for acquiring knowledge about Burp Suite. Subsequent rooms in the Burp module will adopt a more practical approach. Thus, this room will contain a greater emphasis on theoretical content. If you have not yet utilised Burp Suite, it is recommended to carefully read the provided information and actively engage with the tool. Experimentation is essential for grasping the fundamentals of this framework. Combining the information presented here with hands-on exploration will establish a strong foundation for utilising the framework. This will significantly assist you in future rooms.</p>\n<h1 id=\"TASK-2-What-is-burp-suite\"><a href=\"#TASK-2-What-is-burp-suite\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"TASK 2 - What is burp suite ?\"></a>TASK 2 - What is burp suite ?</h1><p>In essence, Burp Suite is a Java-based framework designed to serve as a comprehensive solution for conducting web application penetration testing. It has become the industry standard tool for hands-on security assessments of web and mobile applications, including those that rely on application programming interfaces (APIs).</p>\n<p>Simply put, Burp Suite captures and enables manipulation of all the HTTP&#x2F;HTTPS traffic between a browser and a web server. This fundamental capability forms the backbone of the framework. By intercepting requests, users have the flexibility to route them to various components within the Burp Suite framework, which we will explore in upcoming sections. The ability to intercept, view, and modify web requests before they reach the target server or even manipulate responses before they are received by our browser makes Burp Suite an invaluable tool for manual web application testing.</p>\n<p>Burp Suite is available in different editions. For our purposes, we will focus on the Burp Suite Community Edition, which is freely accessible for non-commercial use within legal boundaries. However, it’s worth noting that Burp Suite also offers Professional and Enterprise editions, which come with advanced features and require licensing:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Burp Suite Professional is an unrestricted version of Burp Suite Community. It comes with features such as:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>  An automated vulnerability scanner.<br>  A fuzzer&#x2F;brute-forcer that isn’t rate limited.<br>  Saving projects for future use and report generation.<br>  A built-in API to allow integration with other tools.<br>  Unrestricted access to add new extensions for greater functionality.<br>  Access to the Burp Suite Collaborator (effectively providing a unique request catcher self-hosted or running on a Portswigger-owned server).</p>\n<p>In short, Burp Suite Professional is a highly potent tool, making it a preferred choice for professionals in the field.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Burp Suite Enterprise, in contrast to the community and professional editions, is primarily utilized for continuous scanning. It features an automated scanner that periodically scans web applications for vulnerabilities, similar to how tools like Nessus perform automated infrastructure scanning. Unlike the other editions, which allow manual attacks from a local machine, Burp Suite Enterprise resides on a server and constantly scans the target web applications for potential vulnerabilities.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/645b19f5d5848d004ab9c9e2/room-content/6b7cdf06b365b6908c41525e8efb86e0.png\" alt=\"i\"></p>\n<p>Due to requiring a license for the Professional and Enterprise editions, we will focus on the core feature set provided by the Burp Suite Community Edition.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The provided demonstrations utilize Burp Suite for Windows. However, the functionality remains consistent with the version installed on the AttackBox.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Answer-the-questions-below\"><a href=\"#Answer-the-questions-below\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Answer the questions below\"></a>Answer the questions below</h2><p><strong>1. Which edition of Burp Suite runs on a server and provides constant scanning for target web apps?</strong><br>Answer: <code>Burp Suite Enterprise</code></p>\n<p><strong>2. Burp Suite is frequently used when attacking web applications and ______ applications.</strong><br>Answers: <code>Mobile</code></p>\n<h1 id=\"TASK-3-Features-of-Burp-Community\"><a href=\"#TASK-3-Features-of-Burp-Community\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"TASK 3 - Features of Burp Community\"></a>TASK 3 - Features of Burp Community</h1><p>Although Burp Suite Community offers a more limited feature set compared to the Professional edition, it still provides an impressive array of tools that are highly valuable for web application testing. Let’s explore some of the key features:</p>\n<p><strong>Proxy:</strong> The Burp Proxy is the most renowned aspect of Burp Suite. It enables interception and modification of requests and responses while interacting with web applications.<br><strong>Repeater:</strong> Another well-known feature. Repeater allows for capturing, modifying, and resending the same request multiple times. This functionality is particularly useful when crafting payloads through trial and error (e.g., in SQLi - Structured Query Language Injection) or testing the functionality of an endpoint for vulnerabilities.<br><strong>Intruder:</strong> Despite rate limitations in Burp Suite Community, Intruder allows for spraying endpoints with requests. It is commonly utilized for brute-force attacks or fuzzing endpoints.<br><strong>Decoder:</strong> Decoder offers a valuable service for data transformation. It can decode captured information or encode payloads before sending them to the target. While alternative services exist for this purpose, leveraging Decoder within Burp Suite can be highly efficient.<br><strong>Comparer:</strong> As the name suggests, Comparer enables the comparison of two pieces of data at either the word or byte level. While not exclusive to Burp Suite, the ability to send potentially large data segments directly to a comparison tool with a single keyboard shortcut significantly accelerates the process.<br><strong>Sequencer:</strong> Sequencer is typically employed when assessing the randomness of tokens, such as session cookie values or other supposedly randomly generated data. If the algorithm used for generating these values lacks secure randomness, it can expose avenues for devastating attacks.<br>Beyond the built-in features, the Java codebase of Burp Suite facilitates the development of extensions to enhance the framework’s functionality. These extensions can be written in Java, Python (using the Java Jython interpreter), or Ruby (using the Java JRuby interpreter). The Burp Suite Extender module allows for quick and easy loading of extensions into the framework, while the marketplace, known as the BApp Store, enables downloading of third-party modules. While certain extensions may require a professional license for integration, there are still a considerable number of extensions available for Burp Community. For instance, the Logger++ module can extend the built-in logging functionality of Burp Suite.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Answer-the-questions-below-1\"><a href=\"#Answer-the-questions-below-1\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Answer the questions below\"></a>Answer the questions below</h2><p><strong>1.

It enables the capture of requests and responses between the user and the target web server. This intercepted traffic can be manipulated, sent to other tools for further processing, or explicitly allowed to continue to its destination.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Points to Understand About the Burp Proxy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Intercepting Requests:</em> When requests are made through the Burp Proxy, they are intercepted and held back from reaching the target server. The requests appear in the Proxy tab, allowing for further actions such as forwarding, dropping, editing, or sending them to other Burp modules. To disable the intercept and allow requests to pass through the proxy without interruption, click the <code>Intercept is on</code> button.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/73989984d0985412a3405ea1d6f8d171.png\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>Taking Control:</em> The ability to intercept requests empowers testers to gain complete control over web traffic, making it invaluable for testing web applications.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><em>Capture and Logging:</em> Burp Suite captures and logs requests made through the proxy by default, even when the interception is turned off. This logging functionality can be helpful for later analysis and review of prior requests.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><em>WebSocket Support:</em> Burp Suite also captures and logs WebSocket communication, providing additional assistance when analysing web applications.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><em>Logs and History:</em> The captured requests can be viewed in the HTTP history and WebSockets history sub-tabs, allowing for retrospective analysis and sending the requests to other Burp modules as needed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/8d5388b41dc847d2af38acf7ef4b116c.png\" alt=\"o\"></p>\n<p>Proxy-specific options can be accessed by clicking the Proxy settings button. These options provide extensive control over the Proxy’s behaviour and functionality. Familiarise yourself with these options to optimize your Burp Proxy usage.</p>\n<p><strong>Some Notable Features in the Proxy Settings</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Response Interception:</em> By default, the proxy does not intercept server responses unless explicitly requested on a per-request basis. The “Intercept responses based on the following rules” checkbox, along with the defined rules, allows for a more flexible response interception.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/e24fd91064186b78014d6afd773d60f3.png\" alt=\"i\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Match and Replace:</em> The “Match and Replace” section in the Proxy settings enables the use of regular expressions (regex) to modify incoming and outgoing requests. This feature allows for dynamic changes, such as modifying the user agent or manipulating cookies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Take the time to explore and experiment with the Proxy options, as this will enhance your understanding and proficiency with the tool.</p>\n<h1 id=\"TASK-9-Connecting-through-the-Proxy-FoxyProxy\"><a href=\"#TASK-9-Connecting-through-the-Proxy-FoxyProxy\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"TASK 9 - Connecting through the Proxy (FoxyProxy)\"></a>TASK 9 - Connecting through the Proxy (FoxyProxy)</h1><p>Start the machine by clicking the Start Machine button at the upper right corner of this task.</p>\n<p>To use the Burp Suite Proxy, we need to configure our local web browser to redirect traffic through Burp Suite.

It consists of three sub-tabs:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Site map:</em> This sub-tab allows us to map out the web applications we are targeting in a tree structure. Every page that we visit while the proxy is active will be displayed on the site map. This feature enables us to automatically generate a site map by simply browsing the web application. In Burp Suite Professional, we can also use the site map to perform automated crawling of the target, exploring links between pages and mapping out as much of the site as possible. Even with Burp Suite Community, we can still utilize the site map to accumulate data during our initial enumeration steps. It is particularly useful for mapping out APIs, as any API endpoints accessed by the web application will be captured in the site map.</p>\n<p><em>Issue definitions:</em> Although Burp Community does not include the full vulnerability scanning functionality available in Burp Suite Professional, we still have access to a list of all the vulnerabilities that the scanner looks for. The Issue definitions section provides an extensive list of web vulnerabilities, complete with descriptions and references. This resource can be valuable for referencing vulnerabilities in reports or assisting in describing a particular vulnerability that may have been identified during manual testing.</p>\n<p><em>Scope settings:</em> This setting allows us to control the target scope in Burp Suite. It enables us to include or exclude specific domains&#x2F;IPs to define the scope of our testing. By managing the scope, we can focus on the web applications we are specifically targeting and avoid capturing unnecessary traffic.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Target tab offers features beyond scoping, allowing us to map out web applications, fine-tune our target scope, and access a comprehensive list of web vulnerabilities for reference purposes.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>\n<p>Take a look around the site on <a href=\"http://machine_ip/\">http://MACHINE_IP/</a> — we will be using this a lot throughout the module.

A Chromium window will pop up, and any requests made in this browser will go through the proxy.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/61ee07fd18e8bac9ec6a566c25a3e814.png\" alt=\"p\"></p>\n<p><em>Note:</em> There are many settings related to the Burp Browser in the project options and user options settings. Make sure to explore and customise them as needed.</p>\n<p>However, if you are running Burp Suite on Linux as the root user (as is the case with the AttackBox), you may encounter an error preventing the Burp Browser from starting due to the inability to create a sandbox environment.</p>\n<p><strong>There are two simple solutions to this:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Smart option:</em> Create a new user and run Burp Suite under a low-privilege account to allow the Burp Browser to run without issues.</li>\n<li><em>Easy option:</em> Go to <code>Settings -&gt; Tools -&gt; Burp&#39;s browser</code> and check the <code>Allow Burp&#39;s browser to run without a sandbox option.</code> Enabling this option will allow the browser to start without a sandbox. However, please be aware that this option is disabled by default for security reasons. If you choose to enable it, exercise caution, as compromising the browser could grant an attacker access to your entire machine. In the training environment of the AttackBox, this is unlikely to be a significant issue, but use it responsibly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"TASK-12-Scoping-and-Targeting\"><a href=\"#TASK-12-Scoping-and-Targeting\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"TASK 12 - Scoping and Targeting\"></a>TASK 12 - Scoping and Targeting</h1><p>Finally, we come to one of the most important aspects of using the Burp Proxy: <em>Scoping.</em></p>\n<p>Capturing and logging all of the traffic can quickly become overwhelming and inconvenient, especially when we only want to focus on specific web applications. This is where scoping comes in.</p>\n<p>By setting a scope for the project, we can define what gets proxied and logged in Burp Suite. We can restrict Burp Suite to target only the specific web application(s) we want to test. The easiest way to do this is by switching to the <code>Target</code> tab, right-clicking on our target from the list on the left, and selecting <code>Add To Scope</code>. Burp will then prompt us to choose whether we want to stop logging anything that is not in scope, and in most cases, we want to select <code>yes.</code></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/645b19f5d5848d004ab9c9e2/room-content/5db0a2b0597830ae32aaaf9b80d73187.gif\" alt=\"o\"></p>\n<p>To check our scope, we can switch to the <code>Scope settings</code> sub-tab within the <code>Target</code> tab.</p>\n<p>The Scope settings window allows us to control our target scope by including or excluding domains&#x2F;IPs. This section is powerful and worth spending time getting familiar with.</p>\n<p>However, even if we disabled logging for out-of-scope traffic, the proxy will still intercept everything. To prevent this, we need to go to the Proxy settings sub-tab and select <code>And URL Is in target scope</code> from the “Intercept Client Requests” section.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/645b19f5d5848d004ab9c9e2/room-content/97db105960dfe71e42855461e3ef0de2.png\" alt=\"o\"></p>\n<p>Enabling this option ensures that the proxy completely ignores any traffic that is not within the defined scope, resulting in a cleaner traffic view in Burp Suite.</p>\n<p>Add <a href=\"http://machine_ip/\">http://MACHINE_IP/</a> to your scope and change the proxy settings to only intercept traffic to in-scope targets.</p>\n<p>See the difference between the amount of traffic getting caught by the proxy before and after limiting the scope.</p>\n<h1 id=\"TASK-13-Proxying-HTTPS\"><a href=\"#TASK-13-Proxying-HTTPS\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"TASK 13 - Proxying HTTPS\"></a>TASK 13 - Proxying HTTPS</h1><p>Note: The AttackBox is already configured to solve the problem posed in this task. If you use the AttackBox and don’t wish to read through the information here, you can skip to the next task.</p>\n<p>When intercepting HTTP traffic, we may encounter an issue when navigating to sites with TLS enabled. For example, when accessing a site like <a href=\"https://google.com/\">https://google.com/</a>, we may receive an error indicating that the PortSwigger Certificate Authority (CA) is not authorised to secure the connection. This happens because the browser does not trust the certificate presented by Burp Suite.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/8b4b43cac91cd9a80622b953598d05eb.png\" alt=\"o\"></p>\n<p>To overcome this issue, we can manually add the PortSwigger CA certificate to our browser’s list of trusted certificate authorities. Here’s how to do it:</p>\n<p><em>1. Download the CA Certificate:</em> With the Burp Proxy activated, navigate to <a href=\"http://burp/cert\">http://burp/cert</a>. This will download a file called <code>cacert.der</code>. Save this file somewhere on your machine.</p>\n<p><em>2. Access Firefox Certificate Settings:</em> Type <code>about:preferences</code> into your Firefox URL bar and press <strong>Enter</strong>. This will take you to the Firefox settings page. Search the page for “certificates” and click on the <strong>View Certificates</strong> button.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/a9de0495b2ac6738520c8f9946afdecb.png\" alt=\"o\"></p>\n<p><em>3. Import the CA Certificate:</em> In the Certificate Manager window, click on the <strong>Import</strong> button. Select the <code>cacert.der</code> file that you downloaded in the previous step.</p>\n<p>*4. Set Trust for the CA Certificate: *In the subsequent window that appears, check the box that says “Trust this CA to identify websites” and click OK.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/23e5cb317d00c1a5e64def1d46fa9301.png\" alt=\"o\"></p>\n<p>By completing these steps, we have added the PortSwigger CA certificate to our list of trusted certificate authorities. Now, we should be able to visit any TLS-enabled site without encountering the certificate error.</p>\n<p>You can watch the following video for a visual demonstration of the full certificate import process:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/fb2a8717ae887eda024a7791d83cefaf.gif\" alt=\"p\"></p>\n<p>By following these instructions, you can ensure that your browser trusts the PortSwigger CA certificate and securely communicates with TLS-enabled websites through the Burp Suite Proxy.</p>\n<h1 id=\"TASK-14-Example-Attack\"><a href=\"#TASK-14-Example-Attack\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"TASK 14 - Example Attack\"></a>TASK 14 - Example Attack</h1><p>Having looked at how to set up and configure our proxy, let’s go through a simplified real-world example.</p>\n<p>We will start by taking a look at the support form at <a href=\"http://10.10.83.85/ticket/\">http://10.10.83.85/ticket/</a>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/5b50c536c72d943a3aa5665bcf8858a5.png\" alt=\"p\"></p>\n<p>In a real-world web app pentest, we would test this for a variety of things, one of which would be Cross-Site Scripting (or XSS). If you have not yet encountered XSS, it can be thought of as injecting a client-side script (usually in Javascript) into a webpage in such a way that it executes. There are various kinds of XSS – the type that we are using here is referred to as “Reflected” XSS, as it only affects the person making the web request.</p>\n<p>Walkthrough<br>Try typing: <code>&lt;script&gt;alert(&quot;Succ3ssful XSS&quot;)&lt;/script&gt;</code>, into the “Contact Email” field. You should find that there is a client-side filter in place which prevents you from adding any special characters that aren’t allowed in email addresses:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/04acd78be44400cf105c7d41b104b7fe.gif\" alt=\"p\"></p>\n<p>Fortunately for us, client-side filters are absurdly easy to bypass. There are a variety of ways we could disable the script or just prevent it from loading in the first place.</p>\n<p>Let’s focus on simply bypassing the filter for now.</p>\n<p>First, make sure that your Burp Proxy is active and that intercept is on.</p>\n<p>Now, enter some legitimate data into the support form. For example: “<a href=\"mailto:&#112;&#x65;&#110;&#x74;&#x65;&#115;&#x74;&#101;&#114;&#x40;&#101;&#x78;&#97;&#x6d;&#x70;&#108;&#x65;&#x2e;&#116;&#104;&#x6d;\">&#112;&#x65;&#110;&#x74;&#x65;&#115;&#x74;&#101;&#114;&#x40;&#101;&#x78;&#97;&#x6d;&#x70;&#108;&#x65;&#x2e;&#116;&#104;&#x6d;</a>“ as an email address, and “Test Attack” as a query.</p>\n<p>Submit the form — the request should be intercepted by the proxy.</p>\n<p>With the request captured in the proxy, we can now change the email field to be our very simple payload from above: <code>&lt;script&gt;alert(&quot;Succ3ssful XSS&quot;)&lt;/script&gt;</code>. After pasting in the payload, we need to select it, then URL encode it with the <code>Ctrl + U</code> shortcut to make it safe to send. This process is shown in the GIF below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/58c5bf5382cdee55ab12e0752d819ebe.gif\" alt=\"p\"></p>\n<p>Finally, press the “Forward” button to send the request.</p>\n<p>You should find an alert box from the site indicating a successful XSS attack!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/0ee12f5040b4c2898a71c1300a76f03f.png\" alt=\"p\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"TASK-15-Conclusion\"><a href=\"#TASK-15-Conclusion\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"TASK 15 - Conclusion\"></a>TASK 15 - Conclusion</h1><p>Congratulations on completing the Burp Basics room!
