Our focus will revolve around the following key aspects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A thorough introduction to Burp Suite.</li>\n<li>A comprehensive overview of the various tools available within the framework.</li>\n<li>Detailed guidance on the process of installing Burp Suite on your system.</li>\n<li>Navigating and configuring Burp Suite.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will also introduce the core of the Burp Suite framework, which is the Burp Proxy. It is important to note that this room primarily serves as a foundational resource for acquiring knowledge about Burp Suite. Subsequent rooms in the Burp module will adopt a more practical approach. Thus, this room will contain a greater emphasis on theoretical content. If you have not yet utilised Burp Suite, it is recommended to carefully read the provided information and actively engage with the tool. Experimentation is essential for grasping the fundamentals of this framework. Combining the information presented here with hands-on exploration will establish a strong foundation for utilising the framework. This will significantly assist you in future rooms.</p>\n<h1 id=\"TASK-2-What-is-burp-suite\"><a href=\"#TASK-2-What-is-burp-suite\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"TASK 2 - What is burp suite ?\"></a>TASK 2 - What is burp suite ?</h1><p>In essence, Burp Suite is a Java-based framework designed to serve as a comprehensive solution for conducting web application penetration testing. It has become the industry standard tool for hands-on security assessments of web and mobile applications, including those that rely on application programming interfaces (APIs).</p>\n<p>Simply put, Burp Suite captures and enables manipulation of all the HTTP&#x2F;HTTPS traffic between a browser and a web server. This fundamental capability forms the backbone of the framework. By intercepting requests, users have the flexibility to route them to various components within the Burp Suite framework, which we will explore in upcoming sections. The ability to intercept, view, and modify web requests before they reach the target server or even manipulate responses before they are received by our browser makes Burp Suite an invaluable tool for manual web application testing.</p>\n<p>Burp Suite is available in different editions. For our purposes, we will focus on the Burp Suite Community Edition, which is freely accessible for non-commercial use within legal boundaries. However, it’s worth noting that Burp Suite also offers Professional and Enterprise editions, which come with advanced features and require licensing:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Burp Suite Professional is an unrestricted version of Burp Suite Community. It comes with features such as:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>  An automated vulnerability scanner.<br>  A fuzzer&#x2F;brute-forcer that isn’t rate limited.<br>  Saving projects for future use and report generation.<br>  A built-in API to allow integration with other tools.<br>  Unrestricted access to add new extensions for greater functionality.<br>  Access to the Burp Suite Collaborator (effectively providing a unique request catcher self-hosted or running on a Portswigger-owned server).</p>\n<p>In short, Burp Suite Professional is a highly potent tool, making it a preferred choice for professionals in the field.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Burp Suite Enterprise, in contrast to the community and professional editions, is primarily utilized for continuous scanning. It features an automated scanner that periodically scans web applications for vulnerabilities, similar to how tools like Nessus perform automated infrastructure scanning. Unlike the other editions, which allow manual attacks from a local machine, Burp Suite Enterprise resides on a server and constantly scans the target web applications for potential vulnerabilities.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/645b19f5d5848d004ab9c9e2/room-content/6b7cdf06b365b6908c41525e8efb86e0.png\" alt=\"i\"></p>\n<p>Due to requiring a license for the Professional and Enterprise editions, we will focus on the core feature set provided by the Burp Suite Community Edition.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The provided demonstrations utilize Burp Suite for Windows. However, the functionality remains consistent with the version installed on the AttackBox.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Answer-the-questions-below\"><a href=\"#Answer-the-questions-below\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Answer the questions below\"></a>Answer the questions below</h2><p><strong>1. Which edition of Burp Suite runs on a server and provides constant scanning for target web apps?</strong><br>Answer: <code>Burp Suite Enterprise</code></p>\n<p><strong>2. Burp Suite is frequently used when attacking web applications and ______ applications.</strong><br>Answers: <code>Mobile</code></p>\n<h1 id=\"TASK-3-Features-of-Burp-Community\"><a href=\"#TASK-3-Features-of-Burp-Community\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"TASK 3 - Features of Burp Community\"></a>TASK 3 - Features of Burp Community</h1><p>Although Burp Suite Community offers a more limited feature set compared to the Professional edition, it still provides an impressive array of tools that are highly valuable for web application testing. Let’s explore some of the key features:</p>\n<p><strong>Proxy:</strong> The Burp Proxy is the most renowned aspect of Burp Suite. It enables interception and modification of requests and responses while interacting with web applications.<br><strong>Repeater:</strong> Another well-known feature. Repeater allows for capturing, modifying, and resending the same request multiple times. This functionality is particularly useful when crafting payloads through trial and error (e.g., in SQLi - Structured Query Language Injection) or testing the functionality of an endpoint for vulnerabilities.<br><strong>Intruder:</strong> Despite rate limitations in Burp Suite Community, Intruder allows for spraying endpoints with requests. It is commonly utilized for brute-force attacks or fuzzing endpoints.<br><strong>Decoder:</strong> Decoder offers a valuable service for data transformation. It can decode captured information or encode payloads before sending them to the target. While alternative services exist for this purpose, leveraging Decoder within Burp Suite can be highly efficient.<br><strong>Comparer:</strong> As the name suggests, Comparer enables the comparison of two pieces of data at either the word or byte level. While not exclusive to Burp Suite, the ability to send potentially large data segments directly to a comparison tool with a single keyboard shortcut significantly accelerates the process.<br><strong>Sequencer:</strong> Sequencer is typically employed when assessing the randomness of tokens, such as session cookie values or other supposedly randomly generated data. If the algorithm used for generating these values lacks secure randomness, it can expose avenues for devastating attacks.<br>Beyond the built-in features, the Java codebase of Burp Suite facilitates the development of extensions to enhance the framework’s functionality. These extensions can be written in Java, Python (using the Java Jython interpreter), or Ruby (using the Java JRuby interpreter). The Burp Suite Extender module allows for quick and easy loading of extensions into the framework, while the marketplace, known as the BApp Store, enables downloading of third-party modules. While certain extensions may require a professional license for integration, there are still a considerable number of extensions available for Burp Community. For instance, the Logger++ module can extend the built-in logging functionality of Burp Suite.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Answer-the-questions-below-1\"><a href=\"#Answer-the-questions-below-1\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Answer the questions below\"></a>Answer the questions below</h2><p><strong>1.

It enables the capture of requests and responses between the user and the target web server. This intercepted traffic can be manipulated, sent to other tools for further processing, or explicitly allowed to continue to its destination.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Points to Understand About the Burp Proxy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Intercepting Requests:</em> When requests are made through the Burp Proxy, they are intercepted and held back from reaching the target server. The requests appear in the Proxy tab, allowing for further actions such as forwarding, dropping, editing, or sending them to other Burp modules. To disable the intercept and allow requests to pass through the proxy without interruption, click the <code>Intercept is on</code> button.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/73989984d0985412a3405ea1d6f8d171.png\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>Taking Control:</em> The ability to intercept requests empowers testers to gain complete control over web traffic, making it invaluable for testing web applications.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><em>Capture and Logging:</em> Burp Suite captures and logs requests made through the proxy by default, even when the interception is turned off. This logging functionality can be helpful for later analysis and review of prior requests.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><em>WebSocket Support:</em> Burp Suite also captures and logs WebSocket communication, providing additional assistance when analysing web applications.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><em>Logs and History:</em> The captured requests can be viewed in the HTTP history and WebSockets history sub-tabs, allowing for retrospective analysis and sending the requests to other Burp modules as needed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/8d5388b41dc847d2af38acf7ef4b116c.png\" alt=\"o\"></p>\n<p>Proxy-specific options can be accessed by clicking the Proxy settings button. These options provide extensive control over the Proxy’s behaviour and functionality. Familiarise yourself with these options to optimize your Burp Proxy usage.</p>\n<p><strong>Some Notable Features in the Proxy Settings</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Response Interception:</em> By default, the proxy does not intercept server responses unless explicitly requested on a per-request basis. The “Intercept responses based on the following rules” checkbox, along with the defined rules, allows for a more flexible response interception.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/e24fd91064186b78014d6afd773d60f3.png\" alt=\"i\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Match and Replace:</em> The “Match and Replace” section in the Proxy settings enables the use of regular expressions (regex) to modify incoming and outgoing requests. This feature allows for dynamic changes, such as modifying the user agent or manipulating cookies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Take the time to explore and experiment with the Proxy options, as this will enhance your understanding and proficiency with the tool.</p>\n<h1 id=\"TASK-9-Connecting-through-the-Proxy-FoxyProxy\"><a href=\"#TASK-9-Connecting-through-the-Proxy-FoxyProxy\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"TASK 9 -
